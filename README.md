# Flight Delay Prediction

A two-stage predictive machine learning engine that forecasts the on-time performance of flights for 15 different airports in the USA based on data collected between 2016 and 2017.

## Abstract

Flights are said to be delayed when they arrive later than the scheduled arrival time. This delay is predominantly influenced by environmental conditions. Flight delay is vexatious for passengers and also incurs an agonizingly high financial loss to airlines and countries.  
A structured prediction system is an indispensable tool to help aviation authorities effectively alleviate flight delays.  
This project aims to build a two-stage machine learning engine to effectively predict the arrival delay of a flight.
